Teloiv: These advertisements are everywhere.
Teloiv: Three years ago, the company named the Clone Project suddenly appears in our country, along with the advanced and sophisticated technology of cloning.
Teloiv: With one single hair from a person and consent from their family, the Clone Project can create an identical clone of that person in only 7 days.
Teloiv: Appearance, characteristic, personality... Everything is just the same from inside out, because clones are created based on the idea of mirror. 
Teloiv: Most amazingly, the clone person even shares the same memory with the original individual, which includes the memories until the day the clone person is created.
Teloiv: The Clone Project became super popular since it was brought into market, and it nearly influenced every citizen's life in this country.
Teloiv: I hope I can have a clone too, then I won't need to go to school myself, and I will have plenty of time to enjoy my life.
Teloiv: But cloning is too expensive to me, and I cannot afford it unless I have a job. After all, it is also not that expensive, and most people could afford it as long as they want one.
