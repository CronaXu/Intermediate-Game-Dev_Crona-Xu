Newspaper: BREAKING NEWS! A clone man in District X was informed that he is a clone, then the clone lost control and stabbed the original person to his death. Now the clone product has already been withdrawn by the Clone Project and destroyed.
Teloiv: Such a disaster. Though all the clones are supposed to be kept from the fact that they are clones, some of them still happen to know the truth.
Teloiv: Then most of these "lucky" clones cannot accept that they are either viewed as tools or just  replacements for someone else, and they don't have human rights. 
They become angry and insane and harmful, and the first thing they want to do would be to kill the original person and take their place, or from their point of view, to take the place that should've belonged to them back.
Teloiv: Only about 10 percent of the clones can accept the fact and continue to live as a clone. 
But that possibility is too small that it is recommended by the Clone Project once a clone finds out he is a clone, the owners should immediately contact the company and they will come to withdraw the clone and send back a new one in 7 days.
Teloiv: Nearly all the people reported to be killed by their clones are people that are too kind. They choose to still keep their clones in their home even though knowing that the clone has already realized that he is a clone. 
They firmly believe that their clones will never hurt them and they have feelings for each other.
Teloiv: It's so stupid risking one's life for clones. This problem exists all the time because people just cannot understand that clones are products, not real humans. They can be replaced and the new ones may even work better!
