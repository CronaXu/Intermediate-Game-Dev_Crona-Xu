Teloiv: Why is there another me talking happily with my parents?! Who are you? Mom, dad, did you make a clone of me without asking for my consent?
Violet: Who is your clone? You are my clone created to go to school and do homework for me! Now that you know the truth, you are already useless. Mom, dad, let's call the Clone Project and hopefully they can send us a new one before next week. 
Teloiv: Wait that's impossible! I'm a real human, and I despise clones! 
Violet: And so do I. You really are my clone, you are just like me.
Teloiv: How dare you to fake my identity! You filthy clone man! I swear that I'm the real human here, with my name!
Violet: What is your name then?
Teloiv: My name is Teloiv!
Violet: And my name is Violet, nice to meet you, my mirror, and good-bye.
* Some staff from the Clone Project went in the piano room, and shot Teloiv to death.
