Teloiv: Why are you crying here? Where are your parents? Do you want me to help you find them? 
Orange: I don't want to see my parents. My parents always say that they want a twin. So they ordered a clone of me from the Clone Project last week, and the clone was sent to our home yesterday.
My parents immediately tells her the fact that she is a clone, and promised that they will treat us both the same. We both happily agreed to be close as twin sisters, but I'm not happy actually.
Orange: I'm not naughty and I love my parents so much, so why do they need to have another me? I can tell that she is not happy as well, even though that is a really nice offer for a clone to live a real human's life. But she didn't show anything.
Orange: Today when I woke up, my parents told me that they were going to take my sister out and buy her some new clothes, and they wanted me to stay at home. She was just standing there, smiling, no, laughing at me.
I know her better than anyone, so I can tell that she is showing off. She also knows that I care about this thing, so she was showing even more proud.
Teloiv: Poor girl! It is essentially not right that a clone takes the place of any living human in this world. Clones always desire what do not belong to them, not realizing that they are just reflections. 
Let me help you. I will call the Clone Project now and tell them that there is a dangerous clone here who has already known the truth. When they come here, you just need to tell them that the dangerous clone is your "sister".
I'm pretty sure that they will take your "sister" away immediately, considering the tragedy happened recently.
Orange: Oh that is such a good idea! Thank you so much! I will do just as you say!
