Teloiv: What is that? It looks like a cyst with human bodies in it.
???: It is not the place for customers. It's foolish of you to come down here, especially when you are a clone yourself.
Teloiv: What are you talking about? I'm not a clone of course. And what is that disgusting thing?
???: This is what happens to clones who are either out of control or know the truth that they are clones. 
???: I know that you are a clone because I remember every clone activated in this store. I don't hate or despite clones. I feel sorry for you because you have to live in a world so cruel like this.
???: But there is little I can do. I cannot change any decision of the government or of our company.
???: You are lucky that I'm on duty today, because I can help you at least. According to the rule, you should be in that recycling machine too if you see it.
???: But I'm not going to do that to you. Go to the underground bar and talk to the bartender, he is a member of our secret organization. 
???: When he ask you what to drink, you must answer cocktail for clones. Then he will help you out from this country.
Teloiv: I still cannot believe it... What about my parents? I cannot leave without them.
???: You must face the truth, boy. They are not your parents! Go quickly now, I'm not sure whether other scientists will come here.
