Bartender: Welcome to my underground bar! What would you like to drink today?
Teloiv: Cocktail for clones, please.
Bartender: I see that you are in trouble. There is an underground lake below the bar, and I have just opened the secret door on the first floor for you. 
Bartender: Jump and go find the boat. You can leave the terrible country sailing along the underground lake. Good luck!
