Newspaper: The Clone Project saves our lives! Recently, a citizen named Rouge lost his wife in a car accident. He was too deep in sorrow so that he considered ending his own life too. 
Fortunately, one of Mr. Rouge's friend persuaded him to order a clone using his wife's hair. Now Mr. Rouge is happily living with his wife again and his normal life is back!
Teloiv: I guess this is why the Clone Project never closes down even though it has so many problems. People want it, need it, and even can't live without it.
Teloiv: There are so many reasons why people need clones, and among them bringing the loved ones back would be the safest. You never need to worry about the clone knowing the fact, because he is already the only living copy of this person in the world.
