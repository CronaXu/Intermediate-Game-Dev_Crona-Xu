Book: ...With one single hair from a person and consent from their family, the Clone Project can create an identical clone of that person in only 7 days.
Appearance, characteristic, personality... Everything is just the same from inside out, because clones are created based on the idea of mirror. 
Most amazingly, the clone person even shares the same memory with the original individual, which includes the memories until the day the clone person is created.
The Clone Project became super popular since it was brought into market, and it nearly influenced every citizen's life in this country.
